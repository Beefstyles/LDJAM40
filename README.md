Ludum dare 40 game.


Top Down Racing game made in Unity for the Ludum Dare 40 Jam.

Playable version here:

Made by Beefsports as part of the prestigious Miserable Pawn Games.

Theme was "The more you have, the worse it is" so my take on it was that you can tune your car to have power, brakes or handling (or some combination) but if you max power then handling and braking etc will be much worse.

Only 1 track in the game and didn't have time to work out AI cars or a ghost car but if you're the sort of person who likes to improve on your time then this is the game for you. Try and work out the best combination of power, brakes and handling that works best for your driving style!

Designed for the use of Xbox360 controller but can use keyboard control as required.

Xbox 360 Controller:

A - Accelerate, B - Brake, Start - Menu, Back - Info

Keyboard:

Left Shift - Accelerate, Left Ctrl - Brake, Escape- Menu, F1- Info
